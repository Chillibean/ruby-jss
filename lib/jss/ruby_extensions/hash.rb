class Hash

  #
  # Convert Hash values to nil.
  #
  # With no block, values equalling the String, or any member of the Array, given
  # will be converted to nil. Equality is evaluated with == and Array#include?
  #
  # With a block, if the result of the block evaluates to true, the value is converted to nil.
  #
  # Subhashes are ignored unless recurse is true.
  #
  # @param to_nils[String,Array] Hash values equal to (==) these become nil. Defaults to empty string
  #
  # @param recurse[Boolean] should sub-Hashes be nillified?
  #
  # @yield [value] Hash values for which the block returns true will become nil.
  #
  # @return [Hash] the hash with the desired values converted to nil
  #
  # @example
  #   hash = {:foo => '', :bar => {:baz => '' }}
  #   hash.jss_nillify!  # {:foo => nil, :bar => {:baz => '' }}
  #
  #   hash = {:foo => '', :bar => {:baz => '' }}
  #   hash.jss_nillify! '', :recurse  # {:foo => nil, :bar => {:baz => nil }}
  #
  #   hash = {:foo => 123, :bar => {:baz => '', :bim => "123" }}
  #   hash.jss_nillify! ['', 123], :recurse # {:foo => nil, :bar => {:baz => nil, :bim => "123" }}
  #
  #   hash = {:foo => 123, :bar => {:baz => '', :bim => "123" }}
  #   hash.jss_nillify!(:anything, :recurse){|v| v.to_i == 123 }  # {:foo => nil, :bar => {:baz => '', :bim => nil }}

  # Since a lot of JSON data from the API comes as deeply-nested structures
  # of Hashes and Arrays, it can be a pain to reference some of the deeper
  # data inside, and it isn't worth coding them out into instance attributes.
  #
  # For example see the 'hardware' subset of a JSS::Computer's API data,
  # which is stored as a Hash in the {JSS::Computer.hardware} attribute.
  #
  # To refer to the percent-full value of one of the machine's drives, you need
  # to use e.g. this:
  #
  #   computer_instance.hardware[:storage].first[:partition][:percentage_full]
  #
  # It would be nice to use method-like chains to access that data,
  # similar to what OpenStruct provides.
  #
  # But, there are two problems with just storing #hardware as an OpenStruct:
  # 1) we'd lose some important Hash methods, like #keys and #values, breaking
  # backward compatibility. 2) OpenStructs only work on the Hash itself, not
  # its contents.
  #
  # So to get the best of both worlds, we use the RecursiveOpenStruct gem
  #
  #   https://github.com/aetherknight/recursive-open-struct
  #
  # which subclasses OpenStruct to be recursive.
  #
  # And, instead of replacing the Hash, we'll add a RecursiveOpenStruct version
  # of itself to itself as an attribute.
  #
  # Now, we can access the same data using this:
  #
  #   computer_instance.hardware.jss_ros.storage.first.partition.percentage_full
  #
  # CAVEAT: Treat these as read-only.
  #
  # While the Hashes themselves may be mutable, their use in ruby-jss Classes
  # should usually be considered read-only - neither the Hash, nor the
  # RecursiveOpenStruct  object created by this method should be changed.
  # Changes to the Hash or the RecursiveOpenStruct are NOT synced between them,
  # and ruby-jss won't know to send such changes back to the API when #update
  # is called.
  #
  # This should be fine for the intended uses. Data like Computer#hardware
  # isn't sent back to the JSS via Computer#update, since it must come
  # from a 'recon' anyway.
  #
  # Data that is sent back to the JSS will have setter methods defined in the
  # class or a mixin module (e.g. the Locatable module).
  #
  # Since the data is functionally read-only, why not use the ImmutableStruct
  # gem, used elsewhere in ruby-jss?
  #
  # Because ImmutableStruct is really for creating fully-fleshed-out read-only
  # classes, with a known set of attributes rather than just giving us a nicer
  # way to access Hash data with arbitrary keys.
