  #
  # A mixin module providing file-upload capabilities to JSSAPIObject subclasses.
  #
  # Classes mixing in this module are required to define a constant UPLOAD_TYPES
  # which is a Hash of :type => :resource pairs, like this:
  #
  #  UPLOAD_TYPES = {
  #     :icon => :mobiledeviceapplicationsicon
  #     :app => mobiledeviceapplicationsipa
  #     :attachment => mobiledeviceapplications
  #   }
  #
  # with one pair for each type of upload that the class can handle.
  # (most of them only handle one, usually :attachment)
  #
  # When the #upload method is called, one of the keys from that Hash must be specified
  #
  # Classes with only one upload type may want to redefine #upload to always call super with
  # that one type.
  #
  # ----
  #
  # Implementation Notes from
  # https://casperserver:8443/api/index.htm#!/fileuploads/uploadFiles_post
  #
  #   POST ...JSSResource/fileuploads/<resource>/<idType>/<id>
  #
  # You can POST different types of files by entering parameters for <resource>, <idType>, and <id>.
  # For example /JSSResource/fileuploads/computers/id/2.
  #
  # Attachments can be uploaded by specifying computers, mobiledevices, enrollmentprofiles, or
  # peripherals as the resource.
  #
  # Icons can be uploaded by specifying policies, ebooks, or mobiledeviceapplicationsicon as the resource.
  #
  # A mobile device application can be uploaded by using mobiledeviceapplicationsipa as the resource.
  #
  # A disk encryption can be uploaded by specifying diskencryptionconfigurations as the resource.
  #
  # idTypes supported are "id" and "name", although peripheral names are not supported.
  #
  # A sample command is:
  #   curl -k -u user:password https://my.jss:8443/JSSResource/fileuploads/computers/id/2 -F name=@/Users/admin/Documents/Sample.doc -X POST
