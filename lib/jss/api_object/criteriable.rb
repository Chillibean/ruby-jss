module JSS

  # A mix-in module that allows objects to handle standardized search Criteria.
  #
  # Some objects in the JSS, such as Advanced Searches and Smart Groups,
  # include a set of Criteria. (i.e conditions which, when met, signify inclusion
  # in a result set.)
  #
  # A {JSS::Criteriable::Criteria} instance is a container for one or more
  # {JSS::Criteriable::Criterion} instances and provides methods for dealing with
  # them easily.
  #
  # When a {JSS::APIObject} subclass includes this module, that subclass
  # will have a :criteria attribute, which holds a {JSS::Criteriable::Criteria}
  # object and can be used to manipulate the Criterion objects inside.
  #
  # The including subclass also gains some instance methods:
  # * #parse_critera - sets up the :criteria attribute during initialization
  # * #criteria= - allows the wholesale replacement of the criteria
  # * #need_to_update - allows the {JSS::Criteriable::Criteria} instance to
  #   inform the subclass instance that it has changed and needs an #update
  #
  # Classes mixing in this module *must*
  # *  If they are Updatable or Creatable, they must insert
  #    self.criteria.rest_xml into their own xml output.
  #
  #
  # @example Working with the criteria of an advanced computer search
  #   # create three Criterion instances (split over multiple lines for clarity)
  #   #
  #   # These find all of jeauxbleaux's computers that have either
  #   # Excel or Word installed
  #
  #   crtn_0 = JSS::Criteriable::Criterion.new(
  #     and_or: :and, # NOTE: the and_or value of the first criterion is ignored
  #     name: 'Username',
  #     search_type: 'is',
  #     value: 'jeauxbleaux'
  #   )
  #
  #   crtn_1 = JSS::Criteriable::Criterion.new(
  #     and_or: :and,
  #     paren: :opening,
  #     name: 'Application Title',
  #     search_type: 'has',
  #     value: 'Microsoft Excel.app'
  #   )
  #
  #   crtn_2 = JSS::Criteriable::Criterion.new(
  #     and_or: :or,
  #     name: 'Application Title',
  #     search_type: 'has',
  #     value: 'Microsoft Word.app',
  #     paren: :closing
  #   )
  #
  #   # use them to create a Criteria instance
  #   crta = JSS::Criteriable::Criteria.new [crtn_0, crtn_1, crtn_2]
  #
  #   # create a new Advanced Search
  #   srch = JSS::AdvancedComputerSearch.make, :name => "my computer search"
  #   srch.display_fields = ["Computer Name"]
  #
  #   # add our Criteria to it
  #   srch.criteria = crta
  #
  #   # create it in the JSS
  #   srch.create # srch.search_results now contains the matching computers
  #
  #   # append a new criterion to the criteria, limiting the search results farther
  #   # to those computers that have done a recon in the past week
  #   srch.criteria.append_criterion JSS::Criteriable::Criterion.new(
  #     and_or: :or,
  #     name: "Last Inventory Update",
  #     search_type: "less than x days ago",
  #     value: 8
  #   )
  #
  #   # save the change to the JSS
  #   srch.save
  #
  #   # fetch the new results
  #   srch.requery_search_results
  #
  #   # oops - that last one should have been :and, not :or
  #   # so replace the last criterion with a correct one
  #   srch.criteria.set_criterion 3, JSS::Criteriable::Criterion.new(
  #     and_or: :and,
  #     name: "Last Inventory Update",
  #     search_type: "less than x days ago",
  #     value: 8
  #   )
  #
  #   # save the change to the JSS
  #   # providing a non-false parameter to #update will automatically
  #   # perform the requery  after the update.
