    # Run an arbitrary jamf binary command.
    #
    # @note Most jamf commands require superuser/root privileges.
    #
    # @param command[String,Symbol] the jamf binary command to run
    #   The command is the single jamf command that comes after the/usr/bin/jamf.
    #
    # @param args[String,Array] the arguments passed to the jamf command.
    #   This is to be passed to Kernel.` (backtick), after being combined with the
    #   jamf binary and the jamf command
    #
    # @param verbose[Boolean] Should the stdout & stderr of the jamf binary be sent to
    #  the current stdout in realtime, as well as returned as a string?
    #
    # @return [String] the stdout & stderr of the jamf binary.
    #
    # @example
    #   These two are equivalent:
    #
    #     JSS::Client.run_jamf "recon", "-assetTag 12345 -department 'IT Support'"
    #
    #     JSS::Client.run_jamf :recon, ['-assetTag', '12345', '-department', 'IT Support'"]

    # captured from $CHILD_STATUS immediately after calling. (See Process::Status)
