module Jamf

  # This module contains Object Model and Enum Constants for all JSONObjects
  # defined in the Jamf Pro API.
  #
  # Generated automatically from the OAPI schema available from the
  # 'api/schema' endpoint of any Jamf Pro server.
  #
  # This file was generated from Jamf Pro version 10.36.1
  #
  module OAPIObjectModels

    # API Object Model and Enums for: JamfProServerUrl
    #
    # This constant defines the attributes of this API object
    # and should be used as the base of the OBJECT_MODEL for the
    # matching class in the Jamf module.
    #
    # Container Objects:
    # Other object models that use this model as the value in one
    # of their attributes.
    #  
    #
    # Sub Objects:
    # Other object models used by this model's attributes.
    #  
    #
    # Endpoints and Privileges:
    # API endpoints and HTTP operations that use this object
    # model, and the Jamf Pro privileges needed to access them.
    #  - '/v1/jamf-pro-server-url:GET', needs permissions: Read JSS URL
    #  - '/v1/jamf-pro-server-url:PUT', needs permissions: Update JSS URL
    #
    # We define this in its own module so that it can be autoloaded
    # by ZeitWerk, and included in other classes and modules.
    #
    # To do so, use:
    #   include Jamf::OAPIObjectModels::JamfProServerUrl
    #
    module JamfProServerUrl

      # These enums are used in the properties below
